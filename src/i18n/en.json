      "1": "One of the observations that prompted us to launch ",
      "1bis": " was that we were sorely lacking in relevant data to measure the environmental impacts of digital technology. Beyond the impacts linked to the electricity consumption of the equipment used to deliver digital services, it is essential to know the impacts of the manufacturing, transport and end of life of all this equipment. Especially since for some of them, such as terminals and displays, these life cycle phases have a much greater impact than their electricity consumption",
      "2": "Until now, the impact measurements of these phases were complex to implement or required proprietary data, and involved times and costs far too important to be carried out regularly, even on simple perimeters.",
      "3": "Boavizta believes that an open and participatory approach would be much more appropriate to make digital environmental impact measurement accessible to as many people as possible.",
      "4": "As such, a database and open methodologies have been developed collectively by the working group and Datavizta aims to make the result of this work accessible in the form of easy to use tools.",

      "9": "Evaluate the impacts of extended life or use in one geographic area rather than another. ", 
      "10": "The server impact assessment tool provides an understanding of the environmental impacts of servers on several criteria (Global Warming Potential, Primary Energy and Abiotic Resource Depletion Potential), over two life cycle phases (use, manufacturing) based on their technical characteristics and context of use."

The table, below the graph, displays the main carbon impact data for all devices referenced in the Boavizta database. You can search on each column of the table to find the specific device or type of device (Monitor, Laptop, Smartphone, Server...) you are interested in. Once the search filter is applied or the line of a device is selected, the graph is updated to show the impacts of all the selected devices.",
      "7": "We invite you, for example, to compare the impacts by category of equipment (Workplace and Datacenter) to realize: the importance of the manufacturing phase compared to the use phase for terminals and screens & the importance of the use phase for equipment present in datacenters. Using the form on the right of the graph, you can then vary the lifespan and choose a region of use for the selected equipment to see, on the graph, how this affects the overall impact and especially the distribution by phase of the life cycle. As an example, you can compare the impacts of using a server in France with those of using it in Poland.",
